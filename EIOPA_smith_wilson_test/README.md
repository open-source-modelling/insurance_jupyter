The risk-free curve is one of the principal inputs into an economic scenario generator. This test recalculates the risk-free curve using the parameters that are claimed to be used.

## This example
In this example, we look at the EIOPA risk free rate publication from August 2022. This example focuses on the EUR curve.
The publication can be found [EIOPA RFR website](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/tools-and-data/risk-free-interest-rate-term-structures_en).

The observed maturities `M_Obs` and the calibrated vector `Qb` can be found in the Excel sheet *EIOPA_RFR_20220831_Qb_SW.xlsx*.
The target maturities (`T_Obs`), the additional parameters (`UFR` and `alpha`).

## Smith&Wilson algorithm

The implementation of the SW algorithm is a slight modification to the original OSM implementation. The original implementation can be found in different languages on the OSM's GitHub repository:
-  [Python](https://github.com/qnity/insurance_python/tree/main/smith%26wilson)
-  [Matlab](https://github.com/qnity/insurance_matlab/tree/main/smith%26wilson)
-  [JavaScript](https://github.com/qnity/insurance_javascript/tree/main/smith-wilson)
