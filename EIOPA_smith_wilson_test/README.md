  üêç EIOPA RFR (Risk free curve) test üêç
 </b>
</h1>

</br>

Every month, EIOPA releases their technical information on the risk free rate term structure that (re)insurers need to use to calculate their technical provisions. This test recalculates the risk-free curve using the parameters that are claimed to be used.

## This example
In this example, we look at the EIOPA risk free rate publication for each month starting from December 2021 onward. The publication can be found [EIOPA RFR website](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/tools-and-data/risk-free-interest-rate-term-structures_en).

## Smith&Wilson algorithm

The implementation of the SW algorithm is a slight modification to the original OSM implementation. The original implementation can be found in different languages on the OSM's GitHub repository:
-  [Python](https://github.com/open-source-modelling/insurance_python/tree/main/Smith%26Wilson)
-  [Matlab](https://github.com/open-source-modelling/insurance_matlab/tree/main/Smith%26Wilson)
-  [JavaScript](https://github.com/open-source-modelling/insurance_javascript/tree/main/Smith-Wilson)

## üöÄ Getting started
Before using Jupyter Notebook, it is recommanded to instal Anaconda. One of the sources that could be usefull to do that is: 

https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html

After making sure that Anaconda is installed, select the monthly submission of interest. For example, the April 2023 submission is here: [April 2023 repository].

For starters, there are a few examples of reports already available for a preview in pdf form ready for downloading. 
An example for United Kingdom using the RFR curve without the Volatility Adjustment (VA) is named 23_APRIL_NOVA_UK.pdf

Other examples include:
 - Italy
 - Slovenia
 - Turkey
 - United Kingdom

all with and without Volatility Adjustment.

To run the report for your own country/curve, download the following files in the same folder:
 - Curves_VA.csv
 - Curves_no_VA.csv
 - EIOPA RISK FREE CURVE APRIL 23 RECALCULATION.ipynb
 - Param_VA.csv
 - Param_no_VA.csv

Open the Jupyter Notebook EIOPA RISK FREE CURVE APRIL 23 RECALCULATION

Select the correct set of input files. Either with or without VA by commenting the unnecessary set of names. For example, in the picture bellow the curves with VA are selected:

Select the country of interest by midifying the variable country. For example in the picture bellow, United Kingdom is selected

Run the workbook.

The result of the test is available at the bottom of the workbook.

A visual representation of residuals is also included in the workbook:
