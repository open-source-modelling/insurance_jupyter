  üêç EIOPA RFR (Risk free curve) test üêç
 </b>
</h1>

</br>

Every month, EIOPA releases their technical information on the risk free rate term structure that (re)insurers need to use to calculate their technical provisions. This test recalculates the risk-free curve using the parameters that are claimed to be used.

## This example
In this example, we look at the EIOPA risk free rate publication for each month starting from December 2021 onward. The publication can be found [EIOPA RFR website](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/tools-and-data/risk-free-interest-rate-term-structures_en).

## Smith&Wilson algorithm

The implementation of the SW algorithm is a slight modification to the original OSM implementation. The original implementation can be found in different languages on the OSM's GitHub repository:
-  [Python](https://github.com/qnity/insurance_python/tree/main/smith%26wilson)
-  [Matlab](https://github.com/qnity/insurance_matlab/tree/main/smith%26wilson)
-  [JavaScript](https://github.com/qnity/insurance_javascript/tree/main/smith-wilson)
